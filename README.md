It will check a player is at a workbench of the level set in the config file as well as checking the player has the required parts to upgrade it which is set in the config file.

Admin commands for the plugin are as follows.

This will reload the config file so you donâ€™t need to restart the server to reload the settings.

The price to upgrade mines and their workbench requirement is set within the config file.

Give Notices are disabled for admin and users to stop the massive chat spam that would happen.
